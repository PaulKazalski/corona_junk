The bad news first... for some reason, I'm having trouble adding L.circle's onto this html.  This issue is above my
paygrade, I'll ask you guys for help tonight then I'll ask the tutors tomorrow.

The neutral news is that I'll need to create a svg box to create the dates and add the group on top of the slider.
That will take time, but it's nothing we haven't seen before.

The good news is the slider portion is functional and interactive on the website!  As an example, I create a slider
that goes from 1 to 10.  There are markers placed on the map, and as you slide the marker to a numerical value, the 
program successfully displays both the city name and the number on the marker.  The PNG files show the results.

The best news is that the slider responds to external functions!  That means once I have the other JS files, it's a 
simple matter of defining the other JS files as functions and executing said functions within the slider.
